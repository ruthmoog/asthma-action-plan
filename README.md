# Asthma Action Plan

Most people with asthma in the UK will have an [action plan](https://www.asthmaandlung.org.uk/conditions/asthma/your-asthma-action-plan) to help control their condition.
This is typically a physical leaflet guide, completed with your healthcare provider - which means it's often not kept on you or at hand when it might be needed.

I decided to digitise my plan, so that I can have it at hand wherever I have my phone with me, and to make it easier to share with family, healthcare workers, or my employer, who might need to reference the instructions in an emergency.
